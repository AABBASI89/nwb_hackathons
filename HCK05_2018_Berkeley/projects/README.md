# What should my hackahon project look like?

* Design your project in a way that you can make significant progress during the hackathon (i.e., 1 - 1.5days). 
* The project should be useful either as is or be something that you or someone else can build on after the hacakthon.
* The project should be relevant to NWB:N. Projects may span a broad range of topics, e.g., integrating new data with NWB:N, developing new features for PyNWB, exploring new problems, or creating tutorials.
* Everyone should be part of project, but not everyone must have their own project. Hacking in teams is fun!
* If your project is about integrating data with NWB:N then you should:
  * know the data and ideally have scripts for reading the data in Python already preparted 
  * bring the data with you to the hackathon  

# How to create a new project

- When you are ready, add a new entry in the list of **Projects** by creating a new `README.md` file in a new subfolder in the `projects` folder, and copying the contents of the [project description template][project-description-template] file into it. Step-by-step instructions for this are:

1. Open [project description template][project-description-template] and copy its full content to the clipboard
1. Go back to the [projects](.) folder on GitHub
1. Click on "Create new file" button
1. Type `YourProjectName/README.md`
1. Paste the previously copied content of project template page into your new `README.md`
1. Update at least your project's **title**, **key investigators**, and **project description** sections
1. Add a link to your project to the [project list](PROJECTS.md)

Note: some steps above may require creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) until your account is given write access.
