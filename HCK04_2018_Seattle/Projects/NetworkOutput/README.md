# Project Description

An efficent, parallizable way to store the results, and even the input, of large-scale in-silico network simulations.

## Objective

1. Create an extension for storing and reading discrete single unit simulation data (ie spike times from a biophysical/point network simulation).
2. Create an extension for continuous data (ie membrane potential, calcium conc). 
   * May have to create a second extension for multi-compartment reporting (ie membrane potential along all sections of the dentrites)

## Approach and Plan

1. Take what has been developed by Stanford and AI.
2. Mix in a bowl.
3. Bake into NWB.
