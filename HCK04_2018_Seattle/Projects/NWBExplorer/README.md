# Project Description

Building on the [preexisting visualisation for NWB1](http://live.geppetto.org/geppetto?load_project_from_id=18) based on [Geppetto](http://www.geppetto.org) we are building an application that can be used by scientists to explore the content of NWB files. Reusing exisiting Geppetto widgets the focus is to build an application that can expose visualisations and workflows that can be useful for scientists.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Create a Django based Geppetto application for NWB Explorer
1. Objective B. Create a NWB Model Interpreter which uses PyNWB
1. Objective C. Hook up preexisting frontend to visualise content of NWB2 file

## Approach and Plan

1. Create application skeleton
1. Explore PyNWB API and prototype the model interpreter
1. Extract metadata and traces
