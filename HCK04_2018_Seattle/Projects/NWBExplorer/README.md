# Project Description

Building on the preexisting visualisation for NWB1 based on Geppetto we are building an application that can be used by scientists to explore the content of NWB files. Reusing exisiting Geppetto widgets the focus is to expose visualisations and workflows that are useful for scientits rather than visualising the file structure of NWB files.

## Objective

1. Objective A. Create a Django based Geppetto application for NWB Explorer
1. Objective B. Create a NWB Model Interpreter which uses PyNWB
1. Objective C. Hook up preexisting frontend to visualise content of NWB2 file

## Approach and Plan

1. Create application skeleton
1. Explore PyNWB API and prototype the model interpreter
1. Extract metadata and traces
