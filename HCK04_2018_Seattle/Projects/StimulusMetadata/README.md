# Project Description

Schema extension to allow flexible description of stimulus protocols, with a focus on being able to compose the description from multiple independent elements. 

**Main discussion:** https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-schema/issues/131


## Objective

1. Objective A. Develop a schema for describing ephys stimuli (pulses, pulse trains, ramps, etc.) where each sweep may contain multiple stimuli combined together. The important part here is to allow descriptions for each type of stimulus to be composed together without creating a new class for each combination.
2. Objective B. Extend / generalize this work (if possible) to describe stimuli in other domains (photostimulation, sensory stimuli, etc.)
