# Improving NWB user adoption and removing pain points

1. Discussion of current pain points. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WGkEtX7yAXMHUC6nhRmvyM7yoimmM_A_uPUI_s2kdak/edit#slide=id.p)


# Notes

## Online Documentation
 

  * Changes to NWB landing page:

    * Make banner smaller
    * Entry points for users, for developers, history, contact, 
    * “NWB is used by these labs”
    * Mailing list is Kavli, not NWB. We should direct people to the google group.


  * We need a landing page for NWB:N (separate from the NWB landing page)

    * cross-linking between documentation

    * indicate that NWB:N is under active development and not guaranteed to be backwards compatible

      * Will, help us with language here please?

    * Look at CMake landing page


  * In new user page:

    * Value proposition - pitch to use NWB

    * Resources

    * Mailing list

    * GitHub

    * Describe various tools in ecosystem (matnwb, pynwb, nwb-schema, etc.)

    * Google group

    * Want to get involved? link to the url to the pre-defined “good first issue” tag


## Outreach

  * Hackathons now, then transition into giving talks at conferences

    * Events:

      * Cosyne
      * Neurohack week
      * SfN
      * CNS


  * Blogging

    * open source guide a good resource for community engagement



## Internal Processes

* Pain points: 
  * recruiting developers
    * on-ramp issues: tag for “good first issue”
      * we should all go through the steps of solving a “good first issue”

* Someone needs to be the person who holds the community together
* Public hangout every two weeks or monthly
  * agenda
  * establish culture
	* aim for 2-5 new users
	* find time, ideally good for europeans
	* Nick to make sure AI is involved in development meetings



## Action items

* Talk to Kavli and propose changes

* Restructure introductory pages to create an example
