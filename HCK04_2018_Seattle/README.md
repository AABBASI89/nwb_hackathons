## Projects [(How to add a new project?)](Projects/README.md)

<a name="ProjectsList"/>

### Visualization tools

- How do I view what is in my NWB file and how that related to my experiment?
- Introspecting into contents of an NWB file

### Data converstion tools

- How do I get my data into NWB?
- Read of legacy 1.x files

### NWB schema extensions: neuronal simulations

- Develop use-cases
- Standardize schema, address duplicaiton of effort with experimental domain

### Schema extension sharing platform

- Organize community-driven extensions
- Schema extensions index/registry (solve the findability problem)


### Neuropixels: Data and tools

- Creation of NWB files
- Extensions to handle cusom neuropixel-related metadata
  - CSD plot
  - Cre +/- info for each cell (from optotagging experiments)
  - Unit quality metrics
  - Layer/depth/area info for each cell

### Operant Conditioning: Data and tools

- Creation of NWB files
- Extensions to handle Operant Conditioning data

### Data storage and backends

- Postgres backend
- File system back end
- Cloud-deplyment and scalability concerns

### Tutorial Development: Pynwb training

- User onboarding (how to use NWB in your projects)
- Developer onboarding (how to contribute to PyNWB)
  - Create contributor best-practices tutuorial 
- Base tutorial coupled with example project

### Tutorial Development: Ophys/Ephys data writing

### Tutorial Development: Data I/O

- Writing large data iteratively
- Writing data with compression
- Create a new data store backend for FORM/NWB
- Converting data from one store to another (There and back again)

### Tutorial Development: Creating schema extensions

## Next Hackathon

<a name="BreakoutSessions"/>

## Breakout Sessions

- Governace model for incorporation of extensions into core
- NWB schema vs pynwb vs project versioning convention
- Create reference/example NWB:N files
- Developer insiders: how does pynwb work?
- CI: Software Process in PyNWB
- How to contribute to PyNWB (step through the process, set up dev env, run tests, submit PR)
