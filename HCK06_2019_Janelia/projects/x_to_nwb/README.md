## Key Investigators

## Project Description

The x_to_nwb package (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ipfx/tree/master/ipfx/x_to_nwb) has been developed to convert 2
of the most common formats for in vitro physiology data - .abf (pClamp, Molecular Devices), and .dat (PatchMaster, HEKA)
into the NWB:N format. These tools are new and this project will be focused on investigating their compatibility.

Other nwb users are welcome to join!
