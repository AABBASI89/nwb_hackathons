# Building NWB Explorer towards integration with OpenSourceBrain.org

## Key Investigators
- Matt Earnshaw (UCL)
<!-- - Investigator 2 (Affiliation)-->

## Project Description
[Open Source Brain](http://opensourcebrain.org) is an open source, web-based resource for visualising, simulating and disseminating standardised models of neurons and circuits from many brain regions including the neocortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Over the next three years we will be extending OSB to include integrated visualisation and analysis of the experimental (anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging and behavioural) data used to build and test such models, alongside the models themselves. By closing the loop between data and models, this new version of OSB will provide accessible models of brain function that can be reused for new scientific questions, by the wider neuroscience community. 

At the 2018 Seattle Hackathon, a first step was made towards this vision with the [NWB Explorer project](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb_hackathons/tree/master/HCK04_2018_Seattle/Projects/NWBExplorer). A workable proof of concept, there remains much work to be done. Our primary goal at the hackathon will be to gather existing NWB datasets to check and improve compatibility with the basic parser of NWB Explorer, determine scientifically useful workflows and the components necessary to support them, and develop a basic widget for exposing in a readable fashion the structure of an NWB file.
