# Work on integrating lab ECoG, behavioral, and imaging data using PyNWB

## Key Investigators

<!-- - Investigator 1 (Affiliation)-->
<!-- - Investigator 2 (Affiliation)-->

- Jessie R. Liu (Chang Lab, UCSF)

## Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

Explore best ways of integrating existing lab data (ECoG, imaging recons, behavioral data) into standardized NWB files, based on lab's needs. Lab members currently have different methods of storing their data (.mat, .h5, etc.).

## Objectives

<!-- Briefly describe the objectives of your project. What would you like to achive?-->

<!-- 1. Objective A. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
<!-- 1. Objective B. Describe it in 1-2 sentences.-->
<!-- 1. ...-->

* Have experience integrating the most common types of lab data (TDT/htk, behavioral logs, imaging) into .nwb files
* Be able to help lab members convert their data/be familiar with existing efforts to convert lab data to NWB format

## Approach and Plan

<!-- 1. Describe the steps of your planned approach to reach the objectives.-->
<!-- 1. ... -->
<!-- 1. ... -->

- Bring 2 example datasets that cover the span of what kind of data lab wants to integrate
- Read over/use existing code that ports lab data into NWB files, become familiar with using it
- Expand upon this code if necessary

## Progress and Next Steps

<!--Populate this section as you are making progress before/during/after the hackathon-->
<!--Describe the progress you have made on the project,e.g., which objectives you have achieved and how.-->
<!--Describe the next steps you are planing to take to complete the project.-->
