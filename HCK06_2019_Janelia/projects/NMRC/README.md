Will integrate all types of data from the Neuromodulation Research Center
1. raw data (nwb.acquisition)
   - data from tdt system (*.sev file)
     - neural data (tdt.Neur)
       - electrode types

     - not neural data 
       - touch pad data (tdt.Stpd)
       - eye movement data
         - x,y time series position (tdt.EYEa)
         - sync time series data from eye movement system (tdt.EYTt)
   
   - motion analysis system
   
   - gait mat system
   
   - 
  
2. preprocessed data

3. general information
   - condition: ('normal', 'mild', 'moderate', '?')  % need to check the field to store this inf
